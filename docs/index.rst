Type-Oriented ProgrAmming Language (Topal)
==========================================

This is an experimental language which is designed to explore how far types can be extended to solve the hard problems that current popular programming languages typically have, like making sure incorrect input cannot cause unexpected behavior or correct version management of all components even when they're written in different programming languages.

It also explores what kind of language you would end up with if you tried to learn from experiences made so far from popular programming paradigms, as well as how category theory might help with composition and validation of structure preservence.

This documentation is divided into three parts:

1. Why? Covered in the first part, background.
2. How? Covered in the next part, design decisions.
3. What? Covered in the last part, core language description.
